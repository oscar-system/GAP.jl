## Analyzing Rubik's Cube using GAP.jl

The following Julia session shows the GAP computations from the
[Rubik's Cube example](https://www.gap-system.org/Doc/Examples/rubik.html)
from the GAP webpages.

We consider the group of transformations of Rubik's magic cube.
If we number the faces of this cube as follows

```
                     +--------------+
                     |              |
                     |  1    2    3 |
                     |              |
                     |  4  top    5 |
                     |              |
                     |  6    7    8 |
                     |              |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
      |              |              |              |              |
      |  9   10   11 | 17   18   19 | 25   26   27 | 33   34   35 |
      |              |              |              |              |
      | 12  left  13 | 20 front  21 | 28 right  29 | 36  rear  37 |
      |              |              |              |              |
      | 14   15   16 | 22   23   24 | 30   31   32 | 38   39   40 |
      |              |              |              |              |
      +--------------+--------------+--------------+--------------+
                     |              |
                     | 41   42   43 |
                     |              |
                     | 44 bottom 45 |
                     |              |
                     | 46   47   48 |
                     |              |
                     +--------------+
```

then the group is generated by the following generators,
corresponding to the six faces of the cube.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cube = @gap("Group(
        ( 1, 3, 8, 6)( 2, 5, 7, 4)( 9,33,25,17)(10,34,26,18)(11,35,27,19),
        ( 9,11,16,14)(10,13,15,12)( 1,17,41,40)( 4,20,44,37)( 6,22,46,35),
        (17,19,24,22)(18,21,23,20)( 6,25,43,16)( 7,28,42,13)( 8,30,41,11),
        (25,27,32,30)(26,29,31,28)( 3,38,43,19)( 5,36,45,21)( 8,33,48,24),
        (33,35,40,38)(34,37,39,36)( 3, 9,46,32)( 2,12,47,29)( 1,14,48,27),
        (41,43,48,46)(42,45,47,44)(14,22,30,38)(15,23,31,39)(16,24,32,40) );")
GAP: <permutation group with 6 generators>
```

First we want to know the size of this group.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cube_size = GAP.Globals.Size(cube)
GAP: 43252003274489856000
```

Since this is a little bit unhandy, let us factorize this number.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cf = GAP.Globals.Collected(GAP.Globals.Factors(cube_size))
GAP: [ [ 2, 27 ], [ 3, 14 ], [ 5, 3 ], [ 7, 2 ], [ 11, 1 ] ]
```

(The result tells us that the size is ``2^{27} 3^{14} 5^3 7^2 11``.)

In order to convert this GAP list to Julia,
we can either use [`gap_to_julia`](@ref) or a suitable `Vector` constructor,
see [Conversions](@ref).
Note that the one-argument version of the former returns a vector of
`Any` objects.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> GAP.gap_to_julia(cf)
5-element Vector{Any}:
 Any[2, 27]
 Any[3, 14]
 Any[5, 3]
 Any[7, 2]
 Any[11, 1]

julia> Vector{Vector{Int}}(cf)
5-element Vector{Vector{Int64}}:
 [2, 27]
 [3, 14]
 [5, 3]
 [7, 2]
 [11, 1]
```

Next let us investigate the operation of the group on the 48 points.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> orbits = GAP.Globals.Orbits(cube, GAP.GapObj(1:48))
GAP: [ [ 1, 3, 17, 14, 8, 38, 9, 41, 19, 48, 22, 6, 30, 33, 43, 11, 46, 40, 24, 27, 25, 35, 16, 32 ], [ 2, 5, 12, 7, 36, 10, 47, 4, 28, 45, 34, 13, 29, 44, 20, 42, 26, 21, 37, 15, 31, 18, 23, 39 ] ]

julia> length(orbits)
2
```

The first orbit contains the points at the corners,
the second those at the edges;
clearly the group cannot move a point at a corner onto a point at an edge.

So to investigate the cube group we first investigate the operation on the
corner points.
Note that the constructed group that describes this operation will operate
on the set `[1..24]`, not on the original set `orbs[1]`.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cube1 = GAP.Globals.Action(cube, orbits[1])
GAP: <permutation group with 6 generators>

julia> GAP.Globals.NrMovedPoints(cube1)
24

julia> GAP.Globals.Size(cube1)
88179840
```

Now this group obviously operates transitively,
but let us test whether it is also primitive.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> corners = GAP.Globals.Blocks(cube1, GAP.Globals.MovedPoints(cube1))
GAP: [ [ 1, 7, 22 ], [ 2, 14, 20 ], [ 3, 12, 16 ], [ 4, 17, 18 ], [ 5, 9, 21 ], [ 6, 10, 24 ], [ 8, 11, 23 ], [ 13, 15, 19 ] ]
```

Those eight blocks correspond to the eight corners of the cube;
on the one hand the group permutes those and on the other hand it permutes
the three points at each corner cyclically.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> blockhom1 = GAP.Globals.ActionHomomorphism(cube1, corners, GAP.Globals.OnSets)
GAP: <action homomorphism>

julia> cube1b = GAP.Globals.Image(blockhom1)
GAP: Group([ (1,2,4,3), (1,3,6,5), (1,5,8,2), (3,4,7,6), (5,6,7,8), (2,8,7,4) ])

julia> GAP.Globals.Size(cube1b)
40320
```

Now a permutation group of degree 8 that has order 40320 must be
the full symmetric group `Sym(8)` on eight points.

The next thing then is to investigate the kernel of this operation on blocks,
i.e., the subgroup of `cube1` of those elements that fix the blocks setwise.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> ker1 = GAP.Globals.Kernel(blockhom1)
GAP: <permutation group with 7 generators>

julia> println(Vector{Int}(GAP.Globals.Factors(GAP.Globals.Size(ker1))))
[3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3]

julia> GAP.Globals.IsElementaryAbelian(ker1)
true
```

We can show that the product of this elementary abelian group ``3^7``
with the `Sym(8)` is semidirect by finding a complement, i.e.,
a subgroup that has trivial intersection with the kernel
and that generates `cube1` together with the kernel.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cmpl1 = GAP.Globals.ComplementClassesRepresentatives(cube1, ker1)
GAP: [ <permutation group of size 40320 with 7 generators> ]

julia> cmpl1 = cmpl1[1]; GAP.Globals.Size(cmpl1)
40320
```

We verify the complement properties:

```jldoctest rubik
julia> GAP.Globals.Size(GAP.Globals.Intersection(cmpl1, ker1))
1

julia> GAP.Globals.ClosureGroup(cmpl1, ker1) == cube1
true
```

There is even a more elegant way to show that `cmpl1` is a complement.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> GAP.Globals.IsBijective(GAP.Globals.RestrictedMapping(blockhom1, cmpl1))
true
```

Of course, theoretically it is clear that `cmpl1` must indeed be a complement.

In fact we know that `cube1` is a subgroup of index 3 in the wreath product
of a cyclic 3 with `Sym(8)`.
This missing index 3 tells us that we do not have total freedom in turning
the corners.
The following tests show that whenever we turn one corner clockwise
we must turn another corner counterclockwise.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> @gap("(1, 7, 22)") in cube1
false

julia> @gap("(1, 7, 22)(2, 20, 14)") in cube1
true
```

More or less the same things happen when we consider the operation of the
cube group on the edges.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> cube2 = GAP.Globals.Action(cube, orbits[2]); GAP.Globals.Size(cube2)
980995276800

julia> edges = GAP.Globals.Blocks(cube2, GAP.Globals.MovedPoints(cube2))
GAP: [ [ 1, 11 ], [ 2, 17 ], [ 3, 19 ], [ 4, 22 ], [ 5, 13 ], [ 6, 8 ], [ 7, 24 ], [ 9, 18 ], [ 10, 21 ], [ 12, 15 ], [ 14, 20 ], [ 16, 23 ] ]

julia> blockhom2 = GAP.Globals.ActionHomomorphism(cube2, edges, GAP.Globals.OnSets);

julia> cube2b = GAP.Globals.Image(blockhom2); GAP.Globals.Size(cube2b)
479001600

julia> ker2 = GAP.Globals.Kernel(blockhom2)
GAP: <permutation group with 11 generators>

julia> GAP.Globals.Factors(GAP.Globals.Size(ker2))
GAP: [ 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2 ]

julia> GAP.Globals.IsElementaryAbelian(ker2)
true

julia> cmpl2 = GAP.Globals.ComplementClassesRepresentatives(cube2, ker2); length(cmpl2)
4
```

So there are even 4 classes of complements here.
This time we get a semidirect product of a ``2^11`` with an `Sym(12)`,
namely a subgroup of index 2 of the wreath product of a cyclic 2 with
`Sym(12)`.
Here the missing index 2 tells us again that we do not have total freedom
in turning the edges.
The following tests show that whenever we flip one edge we must also flip
another edge.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> @gap("(1, 11)") in cube2
false

julia> @gap("(1, 11)(2, 17)") in cube2
true
```

Since `cube1` and `cube2` are the groups describing the actions on the
two orbits of `cube`, it is clear that `cube` is a subdirect product
of those groups, i.e., a subgroup of the direct product.
Comparing the sizes of `cube1`, `cube2`, and `cube` we see that `cube`
must be a subgroup of index 2 in the direct product of those two groups.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> BigInt(GAP.Globals.Size(cube1)) * BigInt(GAP.Globals.Size(cube2))
86504006548979712000

julia> GAP.Globals.Size(cube)
GAP: 43252003274489856000
```

(Note that both `GAP.Globals.Size(cube1)` and `GAP.Globals.Size(cube2)`
have the Julia type `Int64`, and forming their product yields an overflow.
In order to obtain the correct value we have created arbitrary precision
integers for the two values before multiplying them.)

This final missing index 2 tells us that we cannot operate on corners and
edges totally independently.
The following tests show that whenever we exchange a pair of corners
we must also exchange a pair of edges (and vice versa).

```jldoctest rubik
julia> @gap("(17, 19)(11, 8)(6, 25)") in cube
false

julia> @gap("(7, 28)(18, 21)") in cube
false

julia> @gap("(17, 19)(11, 8)(6, 25)(7, 28)(18, 21)") in cube
true
```

As a last part of the structure analysis of the cube group
let us compute the centre of the cube group,
i.e., the subgroup of those operations that can be performed either before
or after any other operation with the same result.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> z = GAP.Globals.Centre(cube)
GAP: Group([ (2,34)(4,10)(5,26)(7,18)(12,37)(13,20)(15,44)(21,28)(23,42)(29,36)(31,45)(39,47) ])
```

We see that the centre contains one nontrivial element,
namely the operation that flips all 12 edges simultaneously.

Finally we turn to the original idea connected with the cube,
namely to find a sequence of turns of the faces that will transform the cube
back into its original state.
This amounts to a decomposition of a given element of the cube group
into a product of the generators.
For this purpose we introduce a free group and a homomorphism of it
onto the cube group.

```jldoctest rubik
julia> f = GAP.Globals.FreeGroup(GAP.GapObj(["t", "l", "f", "r", "e", "b"], recursive =  true))
GAP: <free group on the generators [ t, l, f, r, e, b ]>

julia> fhom = GAP.Globals.GroupHomomorphismByImages(f, cube)
GAP: [ t, l, f, r, e, b ] -> [ (1,3,8,6)(2,5,7,4)(9,33,25,17)(10,34,26,18)(11,35,27,19), (1,17,41,40)(4,20,44,37)(6,22,46,35)(9,11,16,14)(10,13,15,12), (6,25,43,16)(7,28,42,13)(8,30,41,11)(17,19,24,22)(18,21,23,20), (3,38,43,19)(5,36,45,21)(8,33,48,24)(25,27,32,30)(26,29,31,28), (1,14,48,27)(2,12,47,29)(3,9,46,32)(33,35,40,38)(34,37,39,36), (14,22,30,38)(15,23,31,39)(16,24,32,40)(41,43,48,46)(42,45,47,44) ]
```

Using this homomorphism, we can now decompose elements into generators.
The method used utilizes a stabilizer chain and does not enumerate all
group elements, therefore the words obtained are not the shortest possible,
though they are short enough for hand solutions.

The computed decompositions may be different in different sessions,
because they involve the computation of pseudo random elements.
Therefore the results shown in the following may look different in actual
Julia sessions.

First we decompose the nonidentity centre element:

```
julia> zgen = GAP.Globals.GeneratorsOfGroup(z)[1]
GAP: (2,34)(4,10)(5,26)(7,18)(12,37)(13,20)(15,44)(21,28)(23,42)(29,36)(31,45)(39,47)

julia> pre1 = GAP.Globals.PreImagesRepresentative(fhom, zgen)
GAP: l*f*t*f^-1*t^-1*l^-1*f*t*f^2*l*f*l^-2*t*l*f^-1*t^-1*l^-1*t*l*f^2*t*l*t*l^-1*f^-1*l*t^-1*l^-1*f*r*t^-1*r^-1*f^-1*l*t*f*t^-1*f^-1*l^-1*t*f^-1*l^-1*t^-1*l*t*f*t^-2*f*t*f^-1*t^-1*l^-1*t^-1*l*t^-1*l^-1*t*e^-1*t*e*(l*t)^2*e*l^-1*e^-1*t^-1*l^-3*b*f*b^-1*l^-1*f^-1*t*l^-1*f*t*f*l^-1*t^-1*b*r^-1*b^-1*t^-2*e^-1*r*e*r*f^-1*e*t^-1*e^-1*r^-2*t^-2*l^-1*b^-1*r^-1*e^-1

julia> length(pre1)
108
```

Next we decompose some element arbitrarily chosen by us:

```
julia> pre2 = GAP.Globals.PreImagesRepresentative(fhom, @gap("(17, 19)(11, 8)(6, 25)(7, 28)(18, 21)"))
GAP: l^-1*t^-1*l*f*r*t*r^-1*f^-1*l*t*f*t^-1*f^-1*l^-1*t^2*f*t*l*t*l^-1*f^-1*l*t^-1*l^-1*f*t^-1*f^-1*l*t*l^-1*t*l*t^-2*l^-1*f*(t*r*t^-1*r^-1)^2*f^-1*t*l*f^-1*l^-1*f*l^-1*t^-1*l*t^-2*f*t*(f^-1*l^-1)^2*l^-1*f*l*e^-1*t*e*l*t^-1*e^-1*t^-1*e*l*b*f^-1*b^-1

julia> length(pre2)
77
```

Last we let GAP choose a random element ...

```
julia> r = GAP.Globals.Random(cube)
GAP: (1,9,35)(2,26,42,28,47,44,13,12,31,34,5,23,21,39,15,20,37,45)(3,19,46,11,41,33,8,40,6,16,27,25,14,17,22)(4,18,36,10,7,29)(32,38,48)

julia> pre3 = GAP.Globals.PreImagesRepresentative(fhom, r)
GAP: f*b^2*f^-1*r^-1*l^-1*e*b^-2*e^-1*t^2*b^-1*e^-1*b*f*t^2*f^-1*l*t^-1*f*l^-1*b*f^-2*b^-1*l^-1*e^-1*t*e*l^-1*f^-1*l*f*t^-1*(t^-1*l^-1)^2*f^-1*l^-1*f*l*f*t*f^-1*t^-1*l*f^-1*l^-1*f*l^-1*(t^-1*l)^2*f*t*f^-1*t^-1*l^-1*t*l*t^2*l^-1*t^-1*l*t^-1*l^-1*t*f*r*t*r^-1*t^-1*f^-1*l^-1*t^-1*(l*t)^2*f^-1*l^-1*e^-1*f*t^-1*e*l*t^-1*l^-1*t

julia> length(pre3)
94
```

... and we verify that the decomposition is correct:

```
julia> GAP.Globals.Image(fhom, pre3) == r
true
```

This concludes our example.
