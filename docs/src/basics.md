# Basics

## Accessing GAP from Julia

Any global GAP variable and function can be access from Julia via the
[`GAP.Globals`](@ref) object; for example `GAP.Globals.Binomial(5,3)`.

The [`GAP.prompt`](@ref) command can be used to switch to a GAP session that
works like a regular GAP, except that leaving it (via `quit;` or by pressing
Ctrl-D) returns one to a Julia prompt. From the GAP prompt, one can access
Julia variables via the `Julia` object, for example `Julia.binomial(5,3)`. For
more details on how to access Julia from GAP, please consult
[the manual of the GAP package JuliaInterface](../assets/html/JuliaInterface/chap0_mj.html).

Alternatively, one can start GAP in the traditional way, by executing a shell
script. Such a script can be created in a location of your choice via [`GAP.create_gap_sh`](@ref).

## Accessing Julia from GAP

The GAP-Julia interface is fully bidirectional, so it is also possible to access all
Julia functionality from GAP. To learn more about this, please consult
[the manual of the GAP package JuliaInterface](../assets/html/JuliaInterface/chap0_mj.html).
