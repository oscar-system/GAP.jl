    prompt()

Start a GAP prompt where you can enter GAP commands as in a regular GAP
session. This prompt can be left as any GAP prompt by either entering `quit;`
or pressing ctrl-D, which returns to the Julia prompt.

This GAP prompt allows to quickly switch between writing Julia and GAP code in
a session where all data is shared.
