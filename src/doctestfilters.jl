# Define some replacements which are applied in `docs/make.jl` and `test/testmanual.jl`.
# The idea is that the `jldoctest`ed examples in the source files
# have the format that fits to the "current" Julia,
# and that other Julia versions (such as Julia nightly) may show different formats.
# Each regular expression in `GAP_doctestfilters` gets applied to both the
# expected output and the output obtained in the actual evaluation,
# before the comparison of the two values, and matching text gets replaced
# by the empty string.
