# GAP.jl Julia package

This repository contains the [GAP.jl](src/GAP.jl) Julia package, as well as the GAP packages
[`JuliaInterface`](pkg/JuliaInterface) and [`JuliaExperimental`](pkg/JuliaExperimental)
developed for the [GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/)-[Julia](https://julialang.org/) integration
as part of the [OSCAR project](https://oscar.computeralgebra.de).

## Install

To install this package in Julia, use
```
] add GAP
```

## Basic usage

After entering the following in Julia,
```julia
using GAP
```
one may call any GAP function by prefixing its name with `GAP.Globals.`. For example:
```julia
julia> GAP.Globals.SymmetricGroup(3)
GAP: SymmetricGroup( [ 1 .. 3 ] )
```
The Julia types `Int64` and `Bool` are automatically converted to GAP objects.
Several others types of objects can be converted using `GAP.julia_to_gap`:
```julia
julia> x = GAP.julia_to_gap([1,2,3])
GAP: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
Converting back to Julia is done using `GAP.gap_to_julia`.
However, for this one needs to specify the desired type of the resulting object.
For example, to convert the GAP list of integers we just defined back to Julia, we might do this:
```julia
julia> GAP.gap_to_julia(Array{Int64,1}, x)
3-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2
 3
```
