# The GAP package `JuliaInterface'

JuliaInterface provides an interface to the Julia interpreter.

This package is automatically built and installed as part of the Julia package
`GAP.jl`.  It is also automatically loaded by `GAP.jl` resp. when running GAP
through a `gap.sh` script generated by `GAP.create_gap_sh()`.

For details about e.g. reporting issues, copyright & licensing, and so on,
please refer to the `README.md` file of `GAP.jl` (which normally should be two
levels above the directory this file you are reading right now resides in).

For information about its capabilities, please consult the package manual at
<https://oscar-system.github.io/GAP.jl/stable/assets/html/JuliaInterface/chap0_mj.html>.
